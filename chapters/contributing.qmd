This book is made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

### Local development

#### Setup

1. Read the [Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) chapter of the Quarto documentation, which includes details on installation.

#### Preparation

1. Read this guide on how to contribute.
2. Familiarize yourself with [Quarto Books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).

#### Build the book locally

```{bash}
quarto preview
```

#### How to add a new chapter

1. Create a new Quarto document inside the `/chapters` folder
2. Add the new chapter to `_quarto.yml`. Don't forget to specify the full path (including `/chapters/`)

```{yaml}
chapters:
  - index.qmd
  - chapters/YOUR-NEW-CHAPTER.qmd # <1>
  - another-chapter.qmd
```
1. Replace `YOUR-NEW-CHAPTER` with a concise filename.

<details>
<summary>Click here to view the full current `_quarto.yml` file</summary>
```{bash, filename="_quarto.yml"}
#| file: _quarto.yml
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
</details>

### Adding references

References are saved in `references.bib`.

#### Resources

- ["Citations & Footnotes"](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) in the Quarto documentation.
- [HTML options for references](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html#references).

## Images

### Background

Images are stored in a [NextCloud folder]({{< var links.nextcloud >}}).
They are downloaded into the `/static` folder using the command specified in the `Makefile`.

### Add new image

1. Become a collaborator on the [UHH Cloud folder]({{< var links.nextcloud >}})
1. Go to the [UHH Cloud folder]({{< var links.nextcloud >}})
1. Place the new image inside folder
1. Run `make download-images` to retrieve all files from the updated folder

::: {.callout-tip title="What's a Makefile?" collapse="false"}

```{bash, filename="Makefile"}
#| file: Makefile
#| code-line-numbers: true
```

:::

It's also possible to include the `make download-images` as a project script in the `pre-render` script.
This would re-execute `make download-images` before every render.
For the moment, we disabled this option, but it can be enabled in `_quarto.yml`.

## Variables

```{bash, filename="_variables.yml", echo=c(2, 3)}
#| file: _variables.yml
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
