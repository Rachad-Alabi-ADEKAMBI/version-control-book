# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Welcome

Welcome to the world of version control and The {{< var project.title >}} - "{{< var project.subtitle >}}"! 
The purpose of this book is to empower scientists, researchers, and students with the knowledge and skills needed to use the distributed version control system [Git]({{< var links.git >}}) for version control of code and data in scientific settings.

## Who is this book for?

This guide is meant to be a gentle introduction to version control for (aspiring) scientists, who want to become more effective in managing the evolution of digital objects on their computers.
Whether you're conducting experiments, writing code, collaborating with scientific peers, or managing complex data sets, Git provides a robust framework to boost the efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration of your work.
While this book was developed with scientists in mind, it's open to anyone who wants to learn more about Git.
We try to avoid technical jargon as much as we can.
When we discuss best practices in using Git commands, we try to offer multiple alternatives but also give opinionated recommendations as guidance to new users.

## What is the purpose of this book?

Version control can be a real game-changer for your scientific projects. 
By adopting Git, you gain the ability to trace the evolution of your work, experiment with new ideas without fear of irreversible consequences, and collaborate with a global community of researchers.
Of course using Git also adds some layer of complexity to your workflow, especially in the beginning.
We aim to simplify and demystify this versatile tool for you.
Whether you're new to version control or have dabbled in it before, this book aims to add something for all levels of expertise.

### What will you be able to do once you learn Git?
By the end of this book, you will be equipped with skills that can transform the way you manage and share your work. 
Here’s a glimpse of what you’ll be able to achieve:

**Share and Publish Code:**
Make your code and data publicly available, helping with transparency and reproducibility in your research. 
GitHub is widely used for publishing code related to scientific papers, making it an important skill for modern researchers

**Collaborate on Scientific Papers*:**
Utilize branches and tags to manage different versions of your research papers, track changes, and streamline collaboration with co-authors.

**Resolve Conflicts:**
Learn how to effectively handle and reconcile conflicts when working with collaborators, ensuring that everyone’s contributions are integrated smoothly.

**Backup and Recovery:** 
Git not only helps in tracking changes but also acts as a backup system. If you encounter issues with your computer, you can easily move to a different machine, clone your repository, and continue working without missing a beat.

**Create a Personal Website:**
Use Git to set up and maintain a personal website, where updates and content changes can be automated through Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices.

## How to use this book?

Git is fundamentally a command-line tool which means you typically interact with it by typing text-based commands into a small command-line window rather than clicking on buttons in a graphical user interface (GUI) as in many other applications.
This **book focuses on teaching Git from the command line**.
While the command line is arguably the rockier road to learning Git, we believe that it provides more long-term benefits and allows to make use of the full potential of Git.
This book therefore also covers basics of the command line to teach you just enough to interact with Git via the command line effectively.
That being said, if you prefer to interact with Git via a graphical user interface, you can still learn about the fundamental concepts of Git in this book and then implement them in your preferred GUI.
We therefore also showcase a few popular Git GUIs.

We also believe in **learning by doing** and try to **focus on implementation** as much as possible. 
The concepts introduced in this book are accompanied by practical examples, hands-on exercises and quizzes.
Feel free to follow the exercises to gain the necessary "muscle-memory" to start using Git in your day-to-day work.
Try out the commands in each chapter, play around with them or apply them to a project of yours!

This book was initially created for the full-semester course "[Effective Progress Tracking and Collaboration: An Introduction to Version Control of Code and Data](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ws23/)" at [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de), Germany.
The book is therefore structured for a course that is spread out across multiple sessions.
Each chapter and the accompanying quizzes and exercises should roughly fill 90 minutes of class time during a course.

## Why is Git important for your future career?

### Relevance for Data Science and Beyond
In today's job market, particularly in data science, software development, and research-oriented roles, Git is a critical skill. 
Employers value candidates who are proficient in version control as it demonstrates an ability to manage codebases, collaborate effectively with teams, and maintain a history of changes.
Even beyond data science, roles that involve data literacy or any form of digital project management often require knowledge of Git.

###Industry Applications
Many organizations, from tech giants to NGOs, rely on Git and GitHub to manage their projects. 
For example, Airbnb uses Git and R for data analysis and reproducibility, as discussed in a [case study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1392362). 
Learning Git not only enhances your ability to collaborate on projects but also makes you more competitive in the job market.

### Collaboration with Technical Teams
Even if your role doesn't involve writing code, understanding Git can be incredibly beneficial. 
It allows you to collaborate seamlessly with more technical team members, contributing to projects, reviewing changes, and ensuring that the work progresses smoothly. 

### Secure Backup and Easy Recovery
With Git, you don’t have to worry about losing your work due to computer issues. 
Your repositories are safely backed up online (e.g., on [GitHub](https://github.com)), and you can easily restore them on any machine. 
This reliability can be a significant advantage in any professional or academic setting.

## Testimonials

Testimonials of students enrolled in the course ["An Introduction to Version Control of Code and Data"](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ws23/) at University of Hamburg, where this book acted as the primary learning resource:

> The online, tailor-made course book and wiki, along with the exercises and quizzes were incredibly helpful and aided my comprehension.

> All materials are conveniently accessible through a course website and completely open source, thus conveying important principles of good scientific practice beyond version control. I particularly appreciated this open approach!
